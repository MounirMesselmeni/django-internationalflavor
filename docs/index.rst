django-internationalflavor
==========================

:mod:`django-internationalflavor` is born to complement the :mod:`django-localflavor` package. While localflavor is
awesome when you are making a localized app, the reality is often that you need to accommodate for users from multiple
countries. This package aims to fill the gap and provides fields that are designed for use in almost every country.
